# TTS-Proof Roadmap - Post Phase 5

## 🎉 Current Status

**Phase 5 (Grammar Assist)**: ✅ **COMPLETE & DEPLOYED**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Quality validated (87.5% issue detection, 30-40% LLM workload reduction)
- Committed to `dev` branch, pushed to remote
- Production-ready for pre-LLM processing

---

## 🗺️ What's Next?

### Option 1: Web UI Integration 🌐
**Integrate Grammar Assist into the existing React frontend**

**Tasks**:
1. Add grammar toggle to `PrepassControl.tsx` or create new `GrammarControl.tsx`
2. Update backend `/api/process` to support grammar step
3. Add WebSocket messages for grammar progress
4. Update UI to show grammar statistics (typos_fixed, spacing_fixed, etc.)
5. Add configuration UI for safe categories and locale

**Benefits**:
- Users can use grammar assist without CLI
- Consistent with existing prepass workflow
- Real-time progress feedback

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### Option 2: MDP Pipeline Refinement 🔧
**Improve the existing phases based on real-world usage**

**Potential improvements**:
1. **Phase 2 (Prepass Basic)**: Add more Unicode normalization patterns
2. **Phase 3 (Scrubber)**: Tune block detection for specific EPUB sources
3. **Phase 5 (Grammar)**: Expand category mapping as we discover more patterns
4. **All phases**: Optimize performance for large files (>100KB)

**Benefits**:
- Higher quality output
- Better handling of edge cases
- Faster processing for large documents

**Estimated effort**: Ongoing (iterative improvement)

---

### Option 3: Real-World Testing 📚
**Test on actual fiction EPUB files (converted to Markdown)**

**Tasks**:
1. Convert sample EPUB files to Markdown
2. Run full pipeline: `mask → prepass-basic → prepass-advanced → scrubber → grammar`
3. Analyze results and identify gaps
4. Document common EPUB-specific issues
5. Tune configuration for fiction content

**Benefits**:
- Validate against actual use case (amateur fiction, poor translations)
- Discover real-world edge cases
- Build test corpus for future improvements

**Estimated effort**: 2-4 hours

---

### Option 4: LLM Integration 🤖
**Add LLM-based grammar correction as Phase 6**

**What it would do**:
- Use local LLM (LM Studio) for deeper grammar corrections
- Handle typos that LanguageTool misses
- Context-aware corrections (unlike rule-based LanguageTool)
- TTS-specific improvements (stylized text, chat logs, etc.)

**Pipeline would be**:
```
Phase 1: Mask
Phase 2: Prepass Basic (Unicode normalization)
Phase 3: Scrubber (Remove junk)
Phase 5: Grammar Assist (LanguageTool - mechanical fixes)
Phase 6: LLM Grammar (Deep corrections) ← NEW
```

**Benefits**:
- Catches what LanguageTool misses (typos, context-dependent errors)
- Leverages existing LM Studio integration
- Builds on Phase 5 cleanup (LLM focuses on content, not spacing)

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

---

### ~~Option 5: Phase 4 Implementation~~ ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE!
**Phase 4 is `mdp/prepass_advanced.py` - it's been complete all along!**

**What Phase 4 does**:
1. ✅ **Casing normalization**: Converts SHOUTING to normal case (with acronym whitelist)
2. ✅ **Punctuation collapse**: `!!!!` → `!` (configurable policies)
3. ✅ **Ellipsis normalization**: `...` ↔ `…` (configurable style)
4. ✅ **Quote normalization**: Curly → straight quotes (or vice versa)
5. ✅ **Sentence spacing**: Single/double space after periods
6. ✅ **Number/unit spacing**: `5 %` → `5%`, `10 km` → `10km`
7. ✅ **Time format**: `5pm` → `5 p.m.` (configurable)
8. ✅ **Inline footnote removal**: Remove `[^1]` markers (optional)

**Note**: Phase 4 is production-ready and integrated into the CLI pipeline!

---

### Option 6: Performance & Scalability ⚡
**Optimize for batch processing and large files**

**Tasks**:
1. Add multi-file batch processing to CLI
2. Parallelize processing where possible
3. Add progress bars for large files
4. Optimize LanguageTool initialization (reuse instance)
5. Add resume capability for interrupted batch jobs

**Benefits**:
- Process entire EPUB library in one command
- Faster processing for 100+ files
- Better user experience for large workloads

**Estimated effort**: 3-5 hours

---

### Option 7: Documentation & Distribution 📖
**Make TTS-Proof easier to use and share**

**Tasks**:
1. Create comprehensive user guide
2. Add example workflows for different use cases
3. Create video tutorial or animated GIF demos
4. Package for distribution (PyPI, standalone executable)
5. Add GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated testing

**Benefits**:
- Lower barrier to entry for new users
- Professional polish
- Easier maintenance and contributions

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

- Completes the user experience
- Builds on existing frontend infrastructure

### Medium-term (Next Month):
**Option 4: LLM Integration (Phase 6)** 🤖
- Natural next step after Grammar Assist
- Leverages existing LM Studio integration
- Addresses Grammar Assist limitations (typos, context)

### Long-term (Ongoing):
**Option 2: MDP Pipeline Refinement** 🔧
- Continuous improvement based on usage
- Iterative quality enhancement
- Community feedback integration
