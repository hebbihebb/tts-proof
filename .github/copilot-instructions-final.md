# Copilot Instructions - Final Updates Applied

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **Complete** - User feedback incorporated

---

## âœ… Changes Applied Based on User Feedback

### 1. **Added Primary Use Case Statement**
**Location**: Architecture Overview (beginning of document)

```markdown
**Primary Use Case**: Processing fiction EPUB files (converted to Markdown) for TTS 
readability - targeting amateur fiction, poor translations, and problematic formatting. 
Users primarily interact via the web UI for one-shot processing workflows.
```

**Why**: Makes it immediately clear to AI agents what the tool is optimized for, helping them make better architectural decisions aligned with the primary use case.

---

### 2. **Added Fiction EPUB Configuration Example**
**Location**: Section 6 (Configuration System)

Added a practical, copy-paste ready YAML configuration example specifically for the primary use case:

```yaml
# Optimized for amateur fiction, poor translations, TTS readability
unicode_form: 'NFKC'
scrubber:
  enabled: true
  categories:
    authors_notes: true        # Remove author notes at chapter ends
    navigation: true           # Remove "Next Chapter" links
    promos_ads_social: true    # Remove Patreon/Discord promos
    link_farms: true           # Remove link collections
prepass_advanced:
  casing:
    normalize_shouting: true   # Fix ALL CAPS dialogue
  punctuation:
    ellipsis: 'three-dots'     # Standardize ellipsis for TTS
    collapse_runs: true        # Fix "!!!!!" â†’ "!"
```

**Why**: Provides a concrete starting point for the most common use case. Shows exactly which settings matter for fiction/TTS processing.

---

### 3. **Added Library Replacement Note**
**Location**: Dependencies section

```markdown
**Note**: Underlying libraries may be replaced in the future for efficiency or 
simplicity (e.g., Bun instead of Node.js for faster installs, alternative bundlers 
for single-click launching). Avoid tight coupling to specific build tools or 
runtimes where possible.
```

**Why**: 
- Warns AI agents not to make assumptions about permanent library choices
- Encourages loose coupling and abstraction
- Explains that efficiency improvements (like Bun for faster installs) may come later
- Signals that "single-click launching" is a future goal

**Impact**: AI agents will:
- Avoid writing code that tightly couples to Node.js/npm specifics
- Design abstractions that can accommodate different build tools
- Not oppose library changes that improve efficiency
- Keep the "single-click launcher" goal in mind for architectural decisions

---

## ðŸ“Š Final Document Statistics

- **Total lines**: ~475 lines (up from ~450)
- **New use case statement**: 2 lines
- **New config example**: 15 lines with comments
- **New library note**: 3 lines
- **Structure**: Unchanged (same sections, same navigation)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Document Now Optimized For

1. **Primary workflow**: Web UI â†’ one-shot processing â†’ fiction EPUB files
2. **Target content**: Amateur fiction, poor translations, TTS problematic files
3. **Future flexibility**: Library changes for efficiency (Bun, single-click launching)
4. **Practical examples**: Ready-to-use fiction EPUB configuration

## âœ… All User Feedback Addressed

| Feedback | Action Taken | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1. Don't know about integration roadmap | No MDP migration docs added | âœ… |
| 2. Config for fiction EPUB files | Added practical YAML example | âœ… |
| 3. CLI usage only as needed | No CLI expansion added | âœ… |
| 4. Main usage via web UI one-shot | Added use case statement | âœ… |
| 5. Libraries may be replaced (Bun, etc.) | Added note about future changes | âœ… |

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is now:

âœ… **Complete** - All architectural components documented  
âœ… **Practical** - Fiction EPUB config example included  
âœ… **Flexible** - Notes about potential library changes  
âœ… **Focused** - Primary use case clearly stated  
âœ… **Actionable** - No generic advice, only project-specific patterns

AI coding agents can now:
- Understand the primary use case (fiction/TTS)
- Use the provided fiction config as a starting point
- Avoid tight coupling to specific libraries
- Make decisions aligned with "one-shot web UI" workflow
- Keep future efficiency improvements in mind
