# Copilot Instructions Update Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Action**: Enhanced existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with additional details

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Component Documentation** (Key Components section)

**Added specific details for each component:**
- Backend: Listed specific endpoints (`/api/process/{client_id}`, `/api/prepass`, `/api/models`) and Pydantic models
- Backend: Documented `prepass_jobs` dict for job tracking
- Frontend: Listed key components (`FileSelector`, `ModelPicker`, `PrepassControl`, etc.)
- Frontend: Added API service and theme context details
- Core Engine: Listed key functions and checkpoint system details
- Prepass Engine: Added function signatures and JSON format details
- Launcher: Added auto-check and dependency installation details

### 2. **Expanded LM Studio Integration** (Critical Patterns #1)

**Added missing details:**
- Clarified `/api/models?api_base=<endpoint>` endpoint with parameter
- Documented sentinel extraction via `extract_between_sentinels()`
- Added sentinel constant references (`SENTINEL_START`, `SENTINEL_END`)
- **Emphasized intentional typo** in `grammar_promt.txt` filename
- Added prepass prompt file reference
- Included network example: `http://192.168.x.x:1234/v1`
- Documented LLM call signature: `call_lmstudio(api_base, model, prompt, text)`

### 3. **Enhanced WebSocket Documentation** (Critical Patterns #3)

**Added implementation details:**
- Documented `active_connections` dictionary structure
- Added `send_message()` method signature
- Included complete WebSocket message format example with source field
- Specified progress tracking fields

### 4. **Expanded TTS Prepass Detection** (Critical Patterns #4)

**Added technical specifics:**
- Documented `detect_tts_problems()` LLM-based detection
- Added expected JSON format: `{"replacements": [{"find": "...", "replace": "...", "reason": "..."}]}`
- Explained prompt injection mechanism
- Documented job tracking structure: `{"status": "processing" | "cancelled"}`
- Added cancellation endpoint reference

### 5. **Detailed Common Gotchas** (New Section Details)

**Enhanced with practical implementation details:**
1. **Grammar prompt**: Added "do not rename" warning
2. **Port conflicts**: Explained Vite default behavior
3. **WebSocket timing**: Added code references for both frontend and backend checks
4. **Chunk processing**: Added specific function calls and tuple structure
5. **Resume functionality**: Documented checkpoint function signatures
6. **NEW: Sentinel extraction failures**: Added graceful handling behavior
7. **NEW: CORS restrictions**: Added middleware configuration note

## What Was NOT Changed

The following sections remain unchanged as they were already comprehensive:

- ✅ Architecture overview narrative
- ✅ Text processing pipeline pattern
- ✅ File handling conventions
- ✅ Development workflows
- ✅ Testing section
- ✅ Dependencies
- ✅ Frontend/Backend patterns
- ✅ Advanced Testing & Optimization Framework (complete)
- ✅ Integration roadmap and best practices

---

## Key Improvements

### For New AI Agents:
1. **Faster onboarding** - More specific function names and signatures
2. **Clearer patterns** - Example code and data structures included
3. **Fewer mistakes** - Explicit warnings about intentional "typos" and gotchas
4. **Better debugging** - Implementation details for common issues

### For Existing Context:
- Preserves all original comprehensive testing documentation
- Maintains architectural insights and performance optimization details
- Keeps integration roadmap and TTS problem categorization intact

## Verification

Run this command to verify the file is valid:
```bash
# Check for key sections
grep -E "^##" .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Verify typo warning exists
grep "intentional typo" .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Expected sections:
- Architecture Overview
- Critical Patterns (1-5)
- Development Workflows
- Component Patterns
- Integration Points
- Common Gotchas
- Advanced Testing & Optimization Framework
