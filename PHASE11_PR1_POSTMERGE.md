# 🎉 Phase 11 PR-1 Post-Merge Summary

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Branch**: `dev`  
**PR Status**: Merged ✅  
**Tests**: 308 passing ✅

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### Implementation Complete
- ✅ Backend unified pipeline endpoint (`POST /api/run`)
- ✅ Backend blessed models endpoint (`GET /api/blessed-models`)
- ✅ Frontend step toggles component (7 pipeline steps)
- ✅ Frontend blessed model pickers (detector + fixer)
- ✅ Full App.tsx integration with state management
- ✅ WebSocket schema extensions for real-time updates
- ✅ Exit code mapping to user-friendly messages
- ✅ 6 integration tests (all passing)
- ✅ Bug fixes (empty plan handling, import error)

### Code Statistics
- **Total changes**: 14 files
- **Lines added**: +2,072
- **Lines removed**: -54
- **New components**: 3 (StepToggles, BlessedModelPickers, test_web_runner)
- **Test coverage**: 314 tests total (308 fast + 6 integration)

### Key Features Now Working
1. **Step Selection**: Users can toggle which pipeline steps to run
2. **Model Selection**: Users can choose detector/fixer models from blessed list
3. **Unified Pipeline**: Web UI calls same orchestrator as CLI (no forked logic)
4. **Real-time Progress**: WebSocket updates with per-step tracking
5. **Graceful Errors**: Empty plans and model errors handled without crashes
6. **Artifact Generation**: All runs write to `~/.mdp/runs/{run_id}/`

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Went Well
1. **No UI scrapping** - Reused existing components successfully
2. **Direct orchestrator integration** - No subprocess complexity
3. **Comprehensive testing** - 6 integration tests caught issues early
4. **Graceful error handling** - Empty plans and model errors handled elegantly
5. **Live testing** - Found and fixed bugs before merge

### Issues Encountered & Resolved
1. **Import Error**: Non-existent `parse_plan_json` function - removed invalid import
2. **Empty Plan Crash**: ValueError on empty detector plans - added graceful skip
3. **LM Studio JIT Loading**: External issue - documented workaround

### Best Practices Confirmed
- ✅ Test as you build (integration tests before live testing)
- ✅ Document issues immediately (test results doc)
- ✅ Fix bugs before merge (don't defer problems)
- ✅ Comprehensive PR descriptions (easier reviews)
- ✅ Branch naming conventions (`feat/phase11-pr1-*`)

## 🤝 For Future Contributors

### To Continue Phase 11
1. Read `PHASE11_STATUS.md` for current state
2. Follow `PHASE11_PR2_NEXT_STEPS.md` for PR-2 implementation
3. Create branch: `feat/phase11-pr2-report-display`
4. Run tests: `pytest` (fast) and `pytest -m "integration"` (full)
5. Test web UI: `python launch.py`

### To Test Current Features
```bash
# 1. Ensure LM Studio running with models pre-loaded
# 2. Start servers
python launch.py

# 3. Open browser: http://localhost:5173
# 4. Upload Markdown file
# 5. Toggle desired steps
# 6. Select models
# 7. Click "Process with Settings"
# 8. Monitor progress bar
```

### Known Issues to Avoid
- **LM Studio JIT Loading**: Pre-load models before running
- **Grammar Assist**: Install LanguageTool or disable step
- **Integration Tests**: Run with `pytest -m "integration"` (not default)
