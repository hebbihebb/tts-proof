## 🔧 Current System Capabilities

### Working Features ✅
- Upload Markdown files via web UI
- Select pipeline steps via toggles (7 steps)
- Choose detector/fixer models from blessed models (3 options each)
  - qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct (fast, lower accuracy)
  - qwen3-4b-instruct-2507 (balanced, recommended)
  - qwen3-8b (slow, highest quality)
- Run full pipeline with real-time progress
- WebSocket progress updates with per-step tracking
- View formatted report after completion
- View unified diff with color-coded changes
- Download artifacts (output, plan, report JSON)
- Browse run history with timestamps, step/model metadata, and exit codes
- Open the artifact browser modal with previews for text assets
- Download individual artifacts or full ZIP archives; delete completed runs to reclaim space
- Graceful error handling (empty plans, model errors)
- Artifacts written to `~/.mdp/runs/{run_id}/`
- Integration tests for web runner (16 tests total)

### Not Yet Implemented ⏳
- Automated artifact retention policies (future enhancement)
- Frontend test automation (Cypress/Playwright) remains on the backlog

### Known Issues ⚠️
- **LM Studio JIT Loading**: Models must be pre-loaded (external issue)
- **Grammar Assist**: Requires LanguageTool installation (optional step)

---

## 📊 Test Coverage Status

### Unit Tests
- **Fast tests**: 308 passing
- **LLM tests**: Marked, excluded by default
- **Slow tests**: Marked, excluded by default
- **Network tests**: Marked, excluded by default

### Integration Tests
- **Web runner tests**: 16 passing (includes 6 new run history cases)
- **Marked**: Excluded from default pytest
- **Run with**: `pytest -m "integration"`

### Web UI Tests
- **Live testing**: Manual, documented in `docs/PHASE11_PR1_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- **Next**: Add automated frontend tests (future phase)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Users
```bash
# 1. Ensure LM Studio running with models pre-loaded
# 2. Start TTS-Proof servers
python launch.py

# 3. Open browser at http://localhost:5173
# 4. Upload Markdown file
# 5. Toggle desired steps
# 6. Select models (or use defaults)
# 7. Click "Process with Settings"
# 8. Monitor progress bar
```

### For Developers
```bash
# 1. Ensure on dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Run fast tests (default)
pytest

# 3. Run integration tests
pytest -m "integration" -v

# 4. Start development servers
cd backend && uvicorn app:app --reload
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Document the new UI** – Capture screenshots and update `readme.md`/`docs/` with quickstart guidance for run history and artifact browsing.
2. **Plan Phase 12+** – Revisit [`phase-status.md`](./phase-status.md) and align on the next feature set (scrubber tie-breaker, packaging).
3. **Monitor artifact retention** – Determine retention defaults or cleanup automation before the runs directory grows too large.
4. **Expand test coverage** – Explore lightweight frontend regression tests (Playwright/Cypress) now that the UI surface is larger.

## 💡 Operational Notes

### Backend
- Run metadata lives under `RUNS_BASE_DIR` (defaults to `~/.mdp/runs`); override with `MDP_RUNS_DIR` when testing.
- `GET /api/runs` and `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/artifacts` cache metadata as part of the response; keep helper functions (`load_run_metadata`, `update_run_metadata`) in sync if schema evolves.
- Artifact downloads stream from disk; ensure new artifact types declare sensible media types in `download_run_artifact`.

### Frontend
- `RunHistory.tsx` handles refreshing, filtering, and deletion—keep actions idempotent to avoid stale state when wiring future features.
- `ArtifactBrowser.tsx` expects WebSocket progress messages to include `run_id`; maintain message shape when backend evolves.
- Download helpers live in `services/api.ts`; reuse them for any future batch actions to ensure consistent error handling.

### Testing
- `testing/test_run_history.py` houses the integration cases for the new endpoints; add scenarios here when expanding metadata or download capabilities.
- Fast tests remain unaffected; keep new integration tests behind the `integration` marker.

### Documentation
- Update `readme.md` and `ROADMAP.md` whenever UI entry points change.
- Use `docs/phases/phase-status.md` as the index for newly created or migrated phase write-ups.
